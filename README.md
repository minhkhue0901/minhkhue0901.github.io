Let's get to know more about me

## INTRODUCTION
My name is Hai Minh Khue Ta. You can call me Kaylee. My student number is s3785151. "kaylee0901@icloud.com" is my email. I come from Vietnam so obviously I can speak Vietnamese. I am a freshman of Bachelor of Information Technology.
I came to Australia about 3 years ago.
Fun fact: I have a cat which is named Theodore and I love it.

## INTEREST IN IT
  ### 1. Why do I choose IT?
  When I came to Australia, I didn't know what to do when I graduate from Uni. I used to think that I would choose Education instead of IT. At that time, my brother-in-law was an IT supporter. Watching him doing his job, I started feeling interested in being an IT supporter. I want to help the customers to satisfy about my IT product. Also, I like playing games, so I want to create my own game. 
 
 ### 2. Why do I choose RMIT?
  RMIT is a short form of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, that's why it is one of the best university to learn IT. As a student who is interested in IT, why don't I choose IT? Additionally, the campus that I am going to is located in CBD, which is very ideal for me.
  
  ### 3. What do I expect to learn?
  During my course, I would like to learn more about coding, software and how to design a game, or at least a website like what I am doing now.
